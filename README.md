# Text-Generation-With-Markov-Chain-in-Python

In this project, you will learn about Markov chains and use them to build a probabilistic model of an entire bookâ€™s text.  Since it is a beginner level project anyone with intermediate python knowledge can do this project easily.
Markov chains are a simple but fundamental approach to modeling stochastic processes, with many practical applications.  By the end of this project, you will have generated a random new text based on the book you modeled.
# Example for Markov Chain
